# 7. Assignment: Study MOGI-ROS manual & implement PID control!

Luckily there is a nice manual on how to work with ROS:
https://github.com/MOGI-ROS/Week-1-2-Introduction-to-ROS2

And a nice manual on how to work with ROS and Gazebo:
https://github.com/MOGI-ROS/Week-3-4-Gazebo-basics

Study both.

The assignment is controlling (driving?) a simple robot with a PID algorithm. You could for instance make a line follower. 

What to hand in @ canvas?
1) the code of your publisher (either cc or python)
2) a video of a walking/running robot which is controlled py the PID algorithm.
